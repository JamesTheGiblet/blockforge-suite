# BlockForge Suite

**Transform anything into LEGO® - powered by exponential decay mathematics**

BlockForge Suite is a collection of specialized studios that convert digital content into LEGO®-compatible brick designs. Each studio uses **Forge Theory** - a universal mathematical framework based on exponential decay - to intelligently optimize conversions while preserving essential characteristics.

## Development Stages

### ✅ Stage 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)

- [x] Main landing page (index.html)
- [x] PWA manifest
- [x] Shared styles (blockforge branding)
- [x] Forge Theory core engine
- [x] Seven studio placeholders

### ✅ Stage 2: Image Studio (COMPLETE)

- [x] Full image-to-LEGO conversion
- [x] Forge Theory visualization toggle
- [x] Real-time adjustments (contrast, brightness, saturation, sharpness)
- [x] Dithering support
- [x] Background removal
- [x] Grid visualization
- [x] Export: PNG, CSV parts list, HTML instructions
- [x] PWA manifest
- [x] BlockForge branding integrated

### 🔄 Stage 3-8: Remaining Studios (One at a time)

Each studio will be built as a complete, standalone PWA:

- Studio-specific index.html
- Studio manifest.json
- Forge Theory integration
- Decay visualization toggle
- Export capabilities

**Recommended order:**

1. **Image Studio** (most visual, easiest to demo)
2. **Text Studio** (highly practical)
3. **Pattern Studio** (good for testing algorithms)
4. **3D Model Studio** (most complex)
5. **Data Studio** (useful for visualizations)
6. **Architecture Studio** (structural analysis)
7. **Audio Studio** (most experimental)

## Forge Theory

The mathematical foundation of BlockForge:

```
I(t) = I₀ · e^(-λt)
```

Where:

- **I(t)** = Information retained at quantization level t
- **I₀** = Initial information content
- **λ** = Decay constant (varies by content type)
- **t** = Quantization steps applied

This allows BlockForge to find the optimal balance between detail preservation and practical buildability across all conversion types.

## Brand Colors

- **Primary Orange**: #FF6B35
- **Primary Blue**: #004E89
- **Blue Dark**: #003560
- **Orange Light**: #FF8C61

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (no frameworks - keep it simple)
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities (offline, installable)
- **Mathematics**: Forge Theory decay engine (exponential mathematics)
- **Architecture**: Modular studios, shared core

## Philosophy

- **Build what works, ship it, move on** - no sprawling half-finished systems
- **One studio at a time** - complete before moving to next
- **Intelligent optimization** - Forge Theory provides mathematical rigor
- **Practical buildability** - designs work with real LEGO bricks
